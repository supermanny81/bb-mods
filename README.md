# A collection of BB8 mods

Things I've done to my BB8 along the way.

## Chargeport and Power Switch

The relay I used can be found on Amazon, but I have seen comparable models elsewhere.

## Wireless firmware uploads and control!!!!

One, if not my favorite mods.

## WAGO Connector Mount

[WAGO Axle Mount STL](stls/wago_axle_mounts.stl) - Easily secure WAGO connectors to your axle using a zip tie.  Can support 4 WAGO connectors per axle.



## Things I've passed up...

![](assets/wireless_mount.png)

Mount for induction power coils.  These slide into the Halo setup easily.  I decided to not go this route because of the enefiecient power transfer.  The transmitter coils tolerance for out of spec voltage was bad.  I fried my first.  After regulating it, then looking at the power recived on the other end, it about a 50% power loss.  That coupled with the expensive slip ring and parts, I decided to abandon my effort.  But it's here if you like.
